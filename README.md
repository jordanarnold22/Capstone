“There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what is really happening. This leads people who run Major League Baseball teams to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams.”
  							                - Jonah Hill (Moneyball, 2011)

Moneyball and sabermetrics has opened the door for analytics to enter the sports world in a big way. Every sport at this point has been infiltrated by data analytics to some degree which has allowed teams to make more informed decisions about what the keys to success really are, what players will help them achieve success, and what these players are worth. Teams that are on the forefront of the analytics movement are clearly reaping the benefits as we can currently see with teams like the Houston Rockets and the Boston Celtics. Making analytics based decisions can set a team up for years and years of success, while avoiding this trend and sticking to the eye test can drastically decrease a team's chances of longterm success.

I have created a historical dataframe of NBA free agents every year since 2012 and trained a regression model to predict an NBA free agent's first year salary. Using standard statistics, advanced statistics, injury history, legal history, and a number of other variables I was able to acheieve a RMSE of just under $2M.
