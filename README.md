Problem Statement: What are NBA free agents worth? With the recent multi-year rise in the NBA salary cap, predicting how much new free agents will make has become increasingly more difficult. I will make a predictive model for this looking at a number of standard statistics like points, assists, and rebounds as well as some more advanced statistics like true shooting percentage, value over replacement, and player efficiency ratings. I will also make a classification model predicting the team that a given free agent will go to based on team needs, team salary cap availability, how well a team is projected to do, state income tax, and a number of other factors.
